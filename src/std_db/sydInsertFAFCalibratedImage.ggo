description "Create a new (mhd) image from the <image_tomo_1> SPECT image using 
the <mask> mask image (output of sydInsertFAFMask) and the attenuation corrected planar image <image_planar_2>.
The output is the calibrated SPECT with the FAF method, in Bq. It is assumed that all the injected activity is inside the planar image field of view."
